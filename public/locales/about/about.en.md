Hey, I’m Andrey! **Full-stack** dev with **two years** of commercial development experience and I'm on the lookout for opportunities in **big tech**. Originally from **Belarus**, now based in **Moscow**.

I’m actively making **pet projects** and **mentoring** first-year students at my university.

I study web development at **Moscow Polytechnic University**, where I led the development of a website for our **web tech department**, which is now actively used.

Excited for new challenges and growth in a fast-paced environment. Let’s connect!
